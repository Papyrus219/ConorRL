⚙️ How to compile? ⚙️
To compile egame you need install cmake. Just simply type Cmake -B build in console and then compile with make (or ninja if you prefer).

⌨️ Controls ⌨️

movment = arrows
select option/ equip/dequip = enter
pick up/ drop items = p
open / close inventory = i

🤔 Goal 🤔
You need to find the exit! (game will close when you find it)

Good luck!
